Don't let your toilet explode

Toilets will freeze and break in the winter if they are not winterized. I lived off-grid in the woods of NH and converted an outhouse into a flushing toilet.
In order to heat the toilet bowl, I designed a circuit to turn on below a designated threshold using a relay to activate a heating element in the bowl.
Unfortunately I did not have a sufficient power source to have the heater on all winter and everything froze and the porcelain shattered.

This is a simple program using an arduino that will solve the problem assuming you have an appropriate power source for the heating element (I'm working on a
hydroelectric generator from an old truck alternator powered by a stream).
